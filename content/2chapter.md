## Development Operations principles {#sec:devops}

Since people started manufacturing products on a mass scale, the goal is to increase the efficiency of this manufacturing process and reduce waste of time and material. 

One early set of best pracitces for manufacturing was the concept of "Lean manufacturing". (describe?) With the upcoming use of Software as commercial product in the ??? a desire came on to create best practices for developing and operating products the same way as it was already usual in common manufacturing.

In 2009 two Flickr employees - John Allspaw and Paul Hammond, presented their way of combining Development and Operations. Inspired by this presentation a belgian consultant named Patrick Debois formed a new conference - the "Devopsday" in Ghent. This is how the term "DevOps" has been created and prevailed.

Since then DevOps has been established in X% of all companies as an important way to increase their efficiency of Software development. For almost every stage of development there are principles and practices defined and continiuously improved. But before those practices will be explained, a further insight in the business need will be given.
