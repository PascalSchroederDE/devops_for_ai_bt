abstract = {Lean production not only successfully challenged the accepted mass production practices in the automotive industry, significantly shifting the trade-off between productivity and quality, but it also led to a rethinking of a wide range of manufacturing and service operations beyond the high-volume repetitive manufacturing environment. The book ‘The machine that changed the World' that introduced the term ‘lean production' in 1990 has become one of the most widely cited references in operations management over the last decade. Despite the fact that the just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing concept had been known for almost a decade prior, the book played a key role in disseminating the concept outside of Japan. While the technical aspects of lean production have been widely discussed, this paper sets out to investigate the evolution of the research at the MIT International Motor Vehicle Program (IMVP) that led to the conception of the term ‘lean production'. Furthermore, the paper investigates why – despite the pre-existing knowledge of JIT – the program was so influential in promoting the lean production concept. Based on iterating series of interviews with the key authors, contributors and researchers of the time, this paper presents an historical account of the research that led to the formulation and dissemination of one of the most influential manufacturing paradigms of recent times.},

abstract = {The CRISP-DM (CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) project proposed a comprehensive process model for carrying out data mining projects. The process model is independent of both the industry sector and the technology used. In this paper we argue in favor of a standard process model for data mining and report some experiences with the CRISP-DM process model in practice. We applied and tested the CRISP-DM methodology in a response modeling application project. The final goal of the project was to specify a process which can be reliably and efficiently repeated by different people and adapted to different situations. The initial projects were performed by experienced data mining people; future projects are to be performed by people with lower technical skills and with very little time to experiment with different approaches. It turned out, that the CRISP-DM methodology with its distinction of generic and specialized process models provides both the structure and the flexibility necessary to suit the needs of both groups. The generic CRISP-DM process model is useful for planning, communication within and outside the project team, and documentation. The generic check-lists are helpful even for experienced people. The generic process model provides an excellent foundation for developing a specialized process model which prescribes the steps to be taken in detail and which gives practical advice for all these steps.},

abstract = {Cloud Computing, the long-held dream of computing as a utility, has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas for new Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over- provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or under- provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hlarge scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT.},
